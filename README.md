Bulk INTERAC e-Transfer XML Form Generator
The purpose of this project was to simplify the process of creating a XML form that included banking information, recipient information and a SHA-2 Secure Hash Password. Previously was manually typed.

Description
At AETS (the company that I worked for) they gave $5 INTERAC E-Transfer gifts as a thank you for completing their survey. To submit these E-transfers a XML document of all the client information and banking information was to be submitted to RBC (bank we used) to manage the payments. 
RBC Bulk INTERAC e-Transfer required specific tags, formatting, and encryption.
